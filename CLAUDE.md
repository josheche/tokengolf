# TokenGolf — CLAUDE.md

You are working on **TokenGolf**, a CLI game that gamifies Claude Code sessions by turning token/dollar efficiency into a score. This is the primary project context file. Read this fully before doing anything.

## What TokenGolf Is

A Node.js CLI tool that wraps Claude Code sessions with game mechanics. Users declare a quest ("implement pagination for /users"), set a budget ($0.30), pick a model class, then work in Claude Code normally. At the end, they get a score based on how efficiently they used their budget.

**Core insight**: Claude Code already exposes session cost data. TokenGolf adds the game layer — the meaning, the stakes, the achievement system — on top of data that already exists.

**Tagline**: *"Flow mode tracks you. Roguelike mode trains you."*

---

## Two Modes

### Flow Mode
- Passive. No interruption. Just runs in the background.
- SessionStart hook auto-creates a flow run if none is active.
- Post-session: `tokengolf win` shows score + achievements with no pre-configuration.
- For people in flow state who don't want friction.

### Roguelike Mode
- Intentional. Pre-commitment before session starts.
- Declare quest + budget + model class = a "run" with real stakes.
- Budget bust = permadeath. Run logged as a death.
- Floor structure: Write code → Write tests → Fix tests → Code review → PR merged (BOSS)
- For deliberate practice. Trains prompting skills.

**Relationship**: Same engine, same data, same achievement system. Roguelike practice makes Flow sessions better over time. That's the meta loop.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js (ESM, `"type": "module"`)
- **Build**: esbuild (JSX transform, `npm run build` → `dist/cli.js`)
- **TUI**: [Ink v5](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) + [@inkjs/ui v2](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink-ui)
- **CLI parsing**: Commander.js
- **Persistence**: JSON files in `~/.tokengolf/` (no native deps, zero compilation)
- **Claude Code integration**: Hooks via `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Testing**: Vitest (ESM-native, `npm test`)
- **Language**: JavaScript (no TypeScript — keep it simple)

### Build pipeline
Source is JSX (`src/`) → esbuild bundles to `dist/cli.js`. The `bin` in `package.json` points to `dist/cli.js`. Run `npm run build` after any source change. `prepare` runs build automatically on `npm link`/`npm install`.

**Do not test with `node src/cli.js`** — use `node dist/cli.js` or `tokengolf` after `npm link`.

### Why JSON not SQLite
`better-sqlite3` requires native compilation which causes install failures. JSON files in `~/.tokengolf/` are sufficient for the data volume (hundreds of runs max) and have zero friction.

## Claude Code Hooks

Nine hooks in `hooks/` directory, installed via `tokengolf install`. Most complete in < 5s (synchronous JSON I/O). `session-end.js` uses async dynamic imports with a 30s timeout.

### `SessionStart` (`session-start.js`)
- Does NOT read stdin (SessionStart doesn't pipe data)
- Reads `current-run.json`; if no active run, auto-creates a flow mode run
- Auto-detects `effort` from env var or `~/.claude/settings.json`; auto-detects `fastMode` from settings.json
- Increments `sessionCount` on existing runs
- Outputs `additionalContext` injected into Claude's conversation

### `PostToolUse` (`post-tool-use.js`)
- Reads stdin (event JSON with `tool_name`)
- Updates `toolCalls` count in `current-run.json`
- At 80%+ budget: outputs `systemMessage` warning to Claude

### `UserPromptSubmit` (`user-prompt-submit.js`)
- Increments `promptCount`
- At 50% budget: injects halfway nudge as `additionalContext`

### `PreCompact` (`pre-compact.js`)
- Reads stdin (compact event JSON with `trigger` and `context_window.used_percentage`)
- Appends to `compactionEvents` array in `current-run.json`
- Powers gear achievements (Ghost Run, Ultralight, Traveling Light, Overencumbered)

### `SessionEnd` (`session-end.js`)
- Reads stdin for `reason` field (detects Fainted if reason is `'other'`)
- Calls `autoDetectCost(run)` — returns spent, modelBreakdown, thinkingInvocations, thinkingTokens
- Resting runs: updates state with fainted:true, does NOT clear — run continues next session
- Won/died runs: calls `saveRun()` (which runs `calculateAchievements()`), clears state, renders ANSI scorecard

### `PostToolUseFailure` (`post-tool-use-failure.js`)
- Reads stdin (event JSON with `tool_name` and error info)
- Increments `failedToolCalls` in `current-run.json`
- Powers Fumble death mark (≥5 failed tool calls)

### `SubagentStart` (`subagent-start.js`)
- Reads stdin (subagent event JSON)
- Increments `subagentSpawns` in `current-run.json`
- Powers Lone Wolf / Summoner / Army of One achievements

### `Stop` (`stop.js`)
- Reads stdin for turn data
- Increments `turnCount` in `current-run.json`
- Powers Agentic / Obedient turn discipline achievements

### `StatusLine` (`statusline.sh`)
- Bash script; uses `TG_SESSION_JSON=... python3 - "$STATE_FILE" <<'PYEOF'` pattern to avoid heredoc/stdin conflict
- Receives live session JSON (cost, context %, model) via stdin
- Shows: quest/mode | tier emoji + cost [/budget pct%] | [efficiency rating] | [🪶/🎒/📦 ctx%] | model label | [floor]
- Model label: `⚔️ Sonnet`, `⚔️ Sonnet·High`, `🏹 Haiku`, `🧙 Opus·Max`, etc. Effort appended only when explicitly set in settings.json (medium omitted — it's the default)
- Context load: 🪶 green (50–74%), 🎒 yellow (75–89%), 📦 red (90%+); hidden below 50%
- Separator lines (`───────────────`) above and below HUD row
- statusLine config must be an object: `{type:"command", command:"...statusline.sh", padding:1}`

### Hook installation
`tokengolf install` patches `~/.claude/settings.json`. Uses `fs.realpathSync(process.argv[1])` to resolve npm link symlinks to real hook paths. Hook entries tagged with `_tg: true` for reliable dedup. Non-destructive statusLine install: wraps existing statusline if one is configured.

---

## Cost Detection (`src/lib/cost.js`)

`autoDetectCost(run)` is called by `session-end.js` and `tokengolf win/bust`. It:
1. Parses `~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/` transcript files — all `.jsonl` files modified since `run.startedAt`
2. Scans ALL files (not just the main session) — this captures subagent sidechain files where Haiku usage lives
3. Also calls `parseThinkingFromTranscripts(paths)` to count thinking blocks and estimate tokens
4. Returns `{ spent, modelBreakdown, thinkingInvocations, thinkingTokens }`

`process.cwd()` is used (not `run.cwd`) because the user always runs `tokengolf win` from their project directory.

Thinking tokens are estimated from character count ÷ 4 (approximate — displayed with `~` prefix). Invocations = assistant turns containing at least one `{"type":"thinking"}` content block.

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **SessionEnd hook is authoritative for cost/scorecard** — SessionEnd fires on `/exit`, scans transcripts, saves run, and renders ANSI scorecard. `tokengolf win` is a manual override that still works. The Stop hook is also active but only for `turnCount` tracking — it does NOT include `total_cost_usd` so it cannot determine final cost.

2. **Scan all transcripts for multi-model + ultrathink** — Claude Code creates separate `.jsonl` files for subagent sidechains (Haiku usage lives there). Same scan also picks up thinking blocks for ultrathink detection. One pass, all data.

3. **Floors are cosmetic** — Floor structure exists in the data model but isn't enforced. It's a UI element. Full roguelike floor mechanics with per-floor budgets are a future feature.

4. **Flow mode is automatic** — SessionStart hook creates a flow run if none exists. Any Claude Code session is tracked. Just `/exit` and the scorecard appears.

5. **Budget presets are model-calibrated** — `MODEL_BUDGET_TIERS` in score.js defines Diamond/Gold/Silver/Bronze amounts per model class. Wizard calls `getModelBudgets(model)` so Haiku sees $0.15/$0.40/$1.00/$2.50 and Opus sees $2.50/$7.50/$20.00/$50.00. Efficiency ratings (LEGENDARY/EFFICIENT/etc.) still derive as % of whatever budget was committed — no change there.

6. **Ultrathink is natural language, not a slash command** — Writing `ultrathink` in a prompt triggers extended thinking mode. It's tracked via thinking blocks in transcripts, not via any hook. `thinkingInvocations === 0` on a won run = Silent Run achievement; on a died run with invocations > 0 = Hubris death mark.

7. **Death marks fire before the early return** — `calculateAchievements` has an `if (!won) return []` early exit, but death marks (blowout, so_close, tool_happy, silent_death, fumble, expensive_taste, hubris) fire before it. `indecisive` (model switches) and `expensive_taste` also fire on won runs — they're behavior patterns, not death verdicts.

## Working in This Repo

When making changes:
- Keep it ESM (`import/export`, no `require`)
- Ink components are functional React — hooks only, no classes
- State mutations always go through `state.js` and `store.js` — never write to `~/.tokengolf/` directly from components
- Hooks must be fast (< 1s) — no async, no network, JSON file I/O only
- **Always run `npm run build` after source changes**
- **Run `npm test` after score.js changes** — 83 tests catch achievement regressions
- Test hooks standalone: `echo '{"tool_name":"Read"}' | node hooks/post-tool-use.js`
- Remember hooks run in a separate process with no access to shell env vars
- Always `process.exit(0)` at the end of hooks

When adding a new CLI command:
1. Add it to `src/cli.js`
2. Add a component in `src/components/` if it needs a TUI
3. Document it in this file and README.md
